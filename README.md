<p id="birthdayMessage" class="message"> To my dearest Chuba, many many happy returns of the day! 🎂🎈  
Wishing you all the happiness in the world, cause you're worthy of that and so much more. Your kindness, love and ability to feel deeply is what makes you YOU, and are some of the few qualities that i love most about you. I hope your bad experiences in life never make you lose what i believe is your greatest strength. 🌷
You are an amazing person, and I’m so lucky to have you as my friend. Friends may come and go but Chuba is for life 😝❤️. 
You always bring out the best in me and i love how comfortable and at ease i feel around you. That again, is one of your many superpowers- bringing out the best versions of people. The people around you are lucky to be receiving your love, and i believe I'm one of them. I appreciate you today, tomorrow and every other day.Words fall short to express the deep love and appreciation i have for you but hey, I tried. So here's another attempt at trying to convey my love for you through the screen: 
  Roses are red, violets are blue.
  It's impossible to find a friend like you.
  You bless my world with your presence,
And my love for you is really immense. 🤪
  I love you, Chuba. Have a great year until your next birthday. 💐</p>
